          Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
          <br />
          <br />
          My name is Michael and I'm a software developer from Vienna, Austria. I am currently {new Date().getFullYear() - 2001} years old and I'm studying computer science at the Vienna University of Technology.
          I have been passionate about programming since I was 14 years old, starting with some basic Batch scripts and other useless stuff. From there, I started to learn Python and Java, which I still sometimes use today.
          Later on I started to learn Go, Javascript and Typescript, which is what I used to create this website. In addition to that, I also collected some experience with C and C++ while using Linux as a daily driver for some time.
          <br />
          <br />
          My current focus is backend development, with my main programming language being Go. [daemon](https://github.com/zekurio/daemon) is a project that started my journey into Go and I'm still working on it to this day.
          With daemon I also dipped my toes into containerization and databases, with Docker and Postgresql being my current go-to tools.
          <br />
          <br />
          But I am also an avid PC enthusiast and love tinkering with my hardware, with overclocking being my current nemesis. Of course, I also love to play games, with my current favorites being Cyberpunk 2077 and Valorant.
